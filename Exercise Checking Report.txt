Comments..............: Dear inspector, the maximum value of buttons table is 10 and the minimum is 4 according
to the example in the PDF file, we hope that this is what was pleased, one more thing - we made the player 1/player 2 being bold
while their turn to play. However, while playing against the CPU you wouldnt see the Computer label bold , thats because
of the Computer playing so fast and human eye cant see it. If you would like to see that the Computer being bold
in his turn, you can put a MessageBox.Show in the right place. 
We tried to make our best and to make UX best as possbile along the time we had.
Wish you "Shana Tova Umtuka" :).
